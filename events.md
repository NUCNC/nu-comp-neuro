**Big data and data science in neuroscience, Torben Noto**<br>
I'd like to talk about 'big data' and data science in neuroscience. Publicly available neuroscience datasets are rapidly becoming available but actually using these datasets can be tricky. I'm going to introduce a few of these datasets, some successful projects that have used these datasets, as well as some tips and tricks for people interested in using them in the future.

**Theoretical Research Problems** <br>
1. LSTM Neural Networks for sequence to sequence prediction: Focus on preprocessing of data for comparison across datasets, Maite Azcorra Sedano<br>
2. Title TBA, Shiloh Cooper

**Neural coding and decoding in MATLAB, Vivek Sagar** <br>
For the first half of the discussion, we will briefly discuss principles of neural encoding and decoding based on the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306650310).
Second half of the discussion will be based practically implementing these models in MATLAB. We will construct an encoder (and decoder) for mapping position to neural activity (and vice-versa) in MECII grid cells in freely behaving rats. For this we will use the following [dataset](https://www.ntnu.edu/kavli/research/grid-cell-data).

Prerequisites: basic probability theory, coding in MATLAB
